I am a seasoned **Technical Director and AI specialist** with over **30 years of experience** in software development, primarily in the gaming industry. My career has been defined by **a deep focus on artificial intelligence in game development**, designing and implementing complex AI systems that bring virtual worlds to life.  

I have led high-performance engineering teams, driven technological innovation, and delivered large-scale projects at world-renowned companies, including Ubisoft, THQ, and Keywords Studios. My expertise spans **Game AI, Game Engine Development, and Performance Optimization** for cross-platform blockbuster titles such as *Assassin’s Creed*, *Skull & Bones*, and *XDefiant*.  

With a strong foundation in C and C++, Python, and multiple programming languages, I have sucessfully maintained a good balance of coding and senior leadership throughtout my career.

### AI in Game Development  

My work in AI has been central to some of the industry’s most ambitious projects, shaping the way **non-player characters (NPCs), crowds, and vehicles** interact within open worlds. My expertise includes:  

- **AI Navigation & Pathfinding**  
  - Implemented **A\* pathfinding**, **navmesh generation**, and **dynamic obstacle avoidance** to create intelligent and adaptive NPC movements.  
  - Developed **ship traffic AI** for *Assassin’s Creed Origins*, enabling realistic naval encounters with autonomous navigation and **networked avoidance systems**.  

- **AI Behavior Systems**  
  - Designed and optimized **behavior trees**, **state machines**, and **goal-oriented action planning (GOAP)** to drive character decision-making and combat strategies.  
  - Developed **AI spawning and director systems**, dynamically adjusting NPC behaviors based on player actions and game states.  

- **Crowds & Traffic Networks**  
  - Led the development of **highly optimized crowd simulation systems** in *Assassin’s Creed Syndicate*, bringing Victorian London’s river to life.  
  - Engineered **real-time traffic networks**, allowing AI-driven vehicles to interact seamlessly with player-controlled elements while maintaining performance at scale.  

- **AI for Open World Gameplay**  
  - Created **persistent world AI frameworks**, ensuring NPCs and environmental interactions evolve over time.  
  - Developed **hierarchical AI decision-making** to enable complex NPC interactions, adapting to dynamic world conditions and player behavior.  

### AI & Machine Learning  

Recently, I have expanded my AI expertise beyond gaming into **machine learning and AI-driven software development**. I have completed certifications from top institutions, including:  

- **CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** (HarvardX)  
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization** (DeepLearning.AI)  
- **Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization** (Imperial College London)  
- **Generative AI for Software Development** (DeepLearning.AI)  
- **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** (Udemy)  
- **AI Agents Certification** (Hugging Face)  

### Looking Ahead  

Currently, I am on a **professional development journey**, deepening my expertise in **AI, machine learning, and AI-driven products**. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that **enhance user experience, improve immersion, and push the boundaries of interactive AI**.
